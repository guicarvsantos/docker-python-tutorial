# docker-python-tutorial
This is a personal project that I created to learn how to use Docker with Python. Through Docker tutorial, I documented my journey of creating a Docker container for a simple Python application and running it on my local machine.

In this tutorial, I've accomplished the following:

 - Install Docker on my local machine
 - Create a simple Python application
 - Write a Dockerfile to build the application image
 - Build the Docker image
 - Run the Docker container
 - Interact with the running container

I hope that this tutorial is helpful to others who are also learning Docker and Python. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.
